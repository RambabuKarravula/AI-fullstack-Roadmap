## Step 5: Project Management

### For Each Day:
1. **Start**: Create a `START.md` with today's goals
2. **Learn**: Take notes, write code, solve problems
3. **Build**: Complete the day's project
4. **Review**: Reflect on learnings in `COMPLETED.md`
5. **Commit**: Push to GitHub (optional but recommended)

### Example Daily Structure:
```
