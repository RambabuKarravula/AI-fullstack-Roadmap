## How to Use This Structure

### Daily Workflow:
1. **Navigate** to the current day's folder
2. **Create** your learning materials:
   - `notes.md` - Daily notes and concepts
   - `code/` - Practice code and exercises
   - `projects/` - Mini-projects for that day
   - `resources.md` - Links and references
   - `progress.md` - What you learned and challenges faced

### Example Day Structure:
```
Day-XX-Topic-Name/
├── notes.md          # Learning notes
├── code/             # Code examples
│   ├── example1.py
│   └── example2.py
├── project/          # Day's project
│   └── main.py
└── resources.md      # Links and references
```

---

## Quick Navigation Commands

### PowerShell:
```powershell
# Navigate to a specific phase
cd Phase-01-Python-Fundamentals

# Navigate to a specific week
cd Phase-01-Python-Fundamentals\Week-01-Python-Essentials

# Navigate to a specific day
cd Phase-01-Python-Fundamentals\Week-01-Python-Essentials\Day-01-Setup-Syntax

# List all days in current week
dir
```

---

## Progress Tracking

As you complete each day, consider:
- Creating a `COMPLETED.md` file in each day folder
- Updating a master progress tracker (see `PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`)
- Maintaining a learning journal
- Building a portfolio of all your projects

---

## Total Time Commitment

- **Total Days**: 273 days
- **Months**: 6-8 months (at ~1 day per day)
- **Accelerated**: 4-5 months (at ~1.5-2 days per day)
- **Comfortable**: 9-12 months (at ~0.5-0.75 days per day)
